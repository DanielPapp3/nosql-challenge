# nosql-challenge

This repo contains project files relating to a MongoDB project which had students analyzing a NoSQL database provided by the instructors.

The objectives for the project are detailed below:

In part 1 (NoSQL_setup.ipynb), students were tasked with creating a database from the terminal, reading information from it, updating it by inserting a new record, and deleting records that met specific criteria.

In part 2 (NoSQL_analysis.ipynb), students were tasked with conducting an exploratory analysis on the created database. Students wrote queries to find answers to questions asked by a client (Eat Safe, Love).

The code used to conduct this analysis can be found in the root directory of this repository. The original JSON file (establishments.json) used to populate the database can be found within the Resources folder of this repository.
